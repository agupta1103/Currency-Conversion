POST MORTEM REVIEW (PMR):
I found this assignment very interesting, fun, and pretty easy to execute
and write. I understand all the concepts of module 2, and this assignment 
really allowed me to use all the different methods of writing the blocks
of code and executing them. I was able to use shortcut code methods, and
normal coding methods alongside print statements and many more operations
during this assignment. Overall, I feel greatly confident and happy that I
was able to complete this assignment with rather much ease and inherit a
true understanding of all the materials taught in this module.
